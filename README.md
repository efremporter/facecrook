Facecrook is a Facebook clone, with a slight spin. Originally, the plan was to give it a theme and populate the database with "missing person" reports as posts. After two weeks of learning and struggling, I ended up populating the database with fun facts!

In Facecrook, users are able to sign up, log in, and sign in as a guest, using the "guest log in" button.

Once logged in, users are redirected to the feed page. While a user is logged in, he/she can no longer navigate to the sign up or login page. I plan on implementing the feed page, which will have posts from friends on the current user.

Users can then navigate to their own profile by clicking on the Facecrook logo in the top left hand corner. Here, users can create posts and have them update in real-time!

Users can also navigate to another person's profile by typing in their user id. Users can then create posts on another person's wall! It will display the post as well as who wrote it!

In order to build this app, I used a number of technologies. For my backend, I used Ruby on rails and a PostgreSQL database. For my frontend, I used react/redux and javascript. For styling, I used HTML and CSS. In order to get pictures to show and persist (like profile pictures), I used Amazon Web Services (AWS).
